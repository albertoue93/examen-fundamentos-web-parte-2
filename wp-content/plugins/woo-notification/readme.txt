Notification for WooCommerce is a WooCommerce extension that helps you create social proof about a busy store. The plugin displays recent orders on a pop-up, with information about customer name, address, purchased items, product image, purchased time. You can set up to display recent WooCommerce orders. Or if your store is new and there are not many things to show, you can create virtual orders to display from a list of customer names, addresses and selected items. By displaying orders on front-end the plugin will create a social proof of a busy store with many customers and orders. Creating a sense of urgency for visitors, urge them to purchase products. Also by select products to display, you can introduce your new products.
